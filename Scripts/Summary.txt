This will show how to implement linear regression in Python using the following packages:
    Numpy
    Scikit-learn
    statsmodels

Numpy is used for handling arrays.

Linear regression is implemented with either of the following:
    scikit-learn:   if you don't need detailed results and want to use the approach consistent with other regression techniques
    statsmodels:    if you need advanced statistical parameters of a model

When performing linear regression in Python, these are the steps to follow:
    1. Import the packages and classes needed
    2. Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations
    3. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data
    4. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory
    5. Apply the model for predictions
